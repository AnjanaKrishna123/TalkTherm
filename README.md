### Project Description
To design a thermometer with both digital and voice output
To ensure accurate temperature sensing
To create an accessible and user-friendly interface

### The Problem statement
People with visual impairments can‚Äôt easily read a conventional thermometer.

### The Solution
The solution is to use a speaking thermometer. Instead of relying on a visual display, a speaking thermometer announces the temperature aloud, making it accessible for people with visual impairments. This ensures that everyone can accurately and easily receive temperature readings without needing to rely on sight.
