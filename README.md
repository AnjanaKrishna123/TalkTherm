### Project Description
To design a thermometer with both digital and voice output
To ensure accurate temperature sensing
To create an accessible and user-friendly interface

### The Problem statement
People with visual impairments can‚Äôt easily read a conventional thermometer.

### The Solution
The solution is to use a speaking thermometer. Instead of relying on a visual display, a speaking thermometer announces the temperature aloud, making it accessible for people with visual impairments. This ensures that everyone can accurately and easily receive temperature readings without needing to rely on sight.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Hardware:
Microcontroller:  Arduino Uno 
  Temperature Sensor: GY-906 
  Display: 16*2 LCD green JHD  display 
  Audio output: ISD 1820 module 
  Power supply:  5V battery 
  Other Components: Jumper wires, PCB, casing

# Limitation
 The limitation we are facing here is generation of speech dynamically since ISD 1820 is not designed for dynamic speech output.
 We can overcome this by using TTS module like DFPlayer Mini MP3 module as it can store multiple audio files on SD card. 
 So we can trigger the appropriate file based on temperature reading.
